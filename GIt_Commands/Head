In ##most cases head is the reference to the recent commit in active branch 

git show head --> will give log of recent commit 
or 
git show <!-- has code of recent commit -->

git difftool <!-- hashcode of past commit  hascode just above -->
git difftool Head-(how low it is of head 1,2,3 ) Head-(one obove of former)

Detached head --> if you go into some past commit to make changes you are in detach head state
git checkout <!-- has code of old state -->

getting out of detached head
 git checkout master
